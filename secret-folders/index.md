# Secret Folders

> **Note:** Please click the table of contents on the left to see any sub-pages to this one. Click the table of contents on the right to see headings on this page.

Folders allow you to create containers of secrets based on your needs. They help organize your customers, computers, regions, and branch offices, to name a few. Folders can be nested within other folders to create sub-categories for each set of classifications. Secrets can be assigned to these folders and sub-folders. Folders allow you to customize permissions at the folder level, and all secrets within can inherit the folder's permissions. Setting permissions at the folder level ensures future secrets placed in that folder have the same permissions, simplifying management across users and groups.

> **Note:** You can "favorite" a folder in the main menu by right clicking it.
