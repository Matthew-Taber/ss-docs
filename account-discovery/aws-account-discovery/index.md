# AWS Account Discovery

> **Note:** Discovery must be enabled in SS to discover AWS accounts.

SS can scan Amazon Web Services (AWS) for accounts that can access the cloud resource. Two types of secrets can be discovered and managed through SS:

- AWS Access Key: Keys used for programmatic integration with AWS.
- AWS Console Account: User login accounts for AWS.
