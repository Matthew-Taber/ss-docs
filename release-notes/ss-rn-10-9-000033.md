# Secret Server: 10.9.000005/33 Release Notes

Release date:

- December 14, 2020 (on-premises version)
- December 12, 2020 (cloud version)

> **Important:** If you installed Secret Server (SS) as your default or top-level website and you have Privilege Manager (PM) and SS installed together, you may experience the following issues after upgrading to .NET Framework 4.8:
>
> - PM agents will not register.
> - When a PM agent updates itself (using the agent utility), it states that there are zero policies to download.
>
> If you believe this scenario applies to you, please contact Thycotic Support **before** performing a .NET, SS, or PM upgrade.

>**Important:** This release corrects a critical issue discovered in SS version 10.9.000032. Thycotic encourages all customers to upgrade any 10.9.00032 installations to 10.9.000033 as soon as possible. For more information, including remediation (if you have been affected), see the [10.9.000032 Release Notes](../release-notes/ss-rn-10-9-000005.md).

>**Note:** All the original release notes for 10.9.000032 have been moved here for convenience and clarity.


## Upgrade Notes

Thycotic encourages all customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

>**Note:** This version of SS uses a two-step upgrade. See [Upgrading to 10.9.000005/33](../secret-server-setup/upgrading/upgrading-secret-server-10-9-000005/index.md).

## New Features and Enhancements

### HSM Key Rotation

This feature enables customers using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to rotate their root encryption key. Secret Server (SS) supports using an HSM to store the root encryption key for all data in the SS database. Some customers have security policies requiring rotation of all encryption keys. Until now this was a manual process.

### DSV Integration: SSH Key Synchronization

Further enhancing the integration between DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) and SS, the integration now supports customers using DSV to provide PAM services to their DevOps teams. DevOps teams may use SSH keys to access portions of their infrastructure.

### SSH Key Authentication to SSH Terminal

SSH terminal in SS provides SSH access for users who do not want to use the SS UI. This is particularly useful for Linux users. These users commonly use SSH keys to authenticate to servers and services. Providing SSH key authentication to SSH terminal allows them to continue to use their preferred access tools with SS.

### User Interface

- Secret Server now uses the terms allowlist and denylist. See [Thycotic shifts the language used in products and materials to promote inclusivity](https://thycotic.com/company/blog/2020/08/27/thycotic-shifts-tech-language-to-promote-inclusivity/).
- New content has been added to "empty" user interface pages to explain initial actions to be taken by new users to streamline the onboarding experience. There is now more information about what they are able to do with helpful links to the knowledge base and corresponding technical documentation, giving them more confidence as they navigate SS for the first time.
- Ongoing new user interface updates include pages such as User Management, Login, Reports, and Distributed Engine configuration.

### General

- Added the ability to trigger event pipelines on the heartbeat UnableToConnect status. This feature adds a new advanced configuration setting, "Heartbeat: Include UnableToConnect as Heartbeat Failure Event". When toggled to true, this setting allows a user to include UnableToConnect as part of the heartbeat failure event subscriptions. It defaults to false.
- Improved handling of site-based requests in relation to heartbeats and remote password changer.
- Secret Server now integrates with Slack, allowing for notifications and workflow handling. This includes approval requests, recently used secret notifications, and launching secrets.

### Security

- Added protection against malicious remote code execution through CEF log file tampering.

  > **Note:** Only applies to SS on-premise.

- Added protection against malicious argument injection in SSH launcher.

### API

- Fixed an issue to properly display API_AccessDenied as a 403-error code.
- Updated error handling and prompts when editing a group via Active Directory sync. The error for the add has been changed to API_CannotAddRemoveUsersFromDirectoryManagedGroups for clarity. The remove has also been updated to throw that error when the group is from AD sync.
- Created the following new endpoints:

  - Distributed engine
   - Dual controls

  - Distributed engine
   - Secret policy search

  - Distributed engine
   - Ticket System

  - User and group management

### Integrations

- Fixed an issue with ServiceNow validation that caused tickets in "Active" status to fail validation. Added an active status to the default allowed statues for ServiceNow. This auto-populates when ServiceNow is setup.
- Fixed an issue when creating a ServiceNow ticket without a secret caused a failure. The system now validates the secret field being required before proceeding.

### Protocol Handler

Protocol handler is updated for this release. Added SS protocol handler administrative settings that you can configure through Microsoft's Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or through SS itself. One setting controls which domains, URLs, or IP addresses the protocol handler installation may connect to. The other setting ensures protocol handler will never auto-update itself, even if told to by the SS installation that it connects to.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue causing duplication of tbOAuthExpiration. Added process that deletes a tbOAuthExpiration object if one was created earlier in the same request and another one is about to be created.
- Fixed an issue where the date format displays incorrectly according to the date preference set by the user.
- Fixed an issue in RPC where a space in the character set fails PowerShell password changes. We now enclose all parameters that go to the PowerShell Password Changer in double quotes.

- Fixed an issue causing the discovery start time to increase after each interval based on extending completion times. Changed the logic for both discovery and computer scan to run based upon the start date and not run if a scan is in process.
- Fixed an issue where the date format displays incorrectly according to the date preference set by the user.
- Fixed a script issue for ParseDataItems not handling edge case—System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. Added a null check for the return object in ParseDataItems.

## Secret Server Cloud

>**Note:** The following only apply to Secret Server Cloud (SSC). Other issues and features are assumed to affect both on-premises and cloud unless otherwise noted.

### Azure ServiceBus Transport Type Setting

We added a new cloud-only setting called "Azure Service Bus Transport Type" in the global engine settings. This defaults to "Web Sockets," so the outbound port for engines communicating with SSC will only use port 443. Customers may change the setting to "AMQP," which changes the outbound ports to 5671 and 5672.

### Other Issues

- Resolved an issue with Thycotic One user synchronization.
- Resolved an issue that could cause repeated errors when accessing the OTP value for a secret.
- Changed some log entry types to warnings instead of errors.
- Fixed a bug that caused a SQL "incorrect parameter order" error when more than 2000 secrets were processed by RPC. 

## Known Issues

> **Important:** If you encounter any of these known issues, please contact [Thycotic Support](mailto:support@thycotic.com) for assistance.

> **Note:** These issues no longer apply to Secret Server Cloud as of December 19th.

- When used with Connection Manager, secrets that have a configured allow list for server connections will not display the allow list in the Connection Manager UI. This issue will be resolved in Connection Manager 1.4, scheduled for release on Dec 15, 2020.
- Secret Server on-premises installations may experience memory leak issues, which can be remedied by performing an IIS reset or application pool recycle.
- When creating a new user, the ability to select a domain is not displayed.
- Secret Server on-premises installations may experience memory leak issues, which can be remedied by performing an IIS reset or application pool recycle.
- Users configured for SAML are not correctly directed to the SAML login page when attempting to log in. Users will have to select "Local Login". This also applies to users that have MFA enabled in SS—the user is incorrectly redirected after SAML login.
- Secret Server on-premises installations may experience memory leak issues, which can be remedied by performing an IIS reset or application pool recycle.
- Users with view permissions can no longer see generated OTP codes on secrets.
