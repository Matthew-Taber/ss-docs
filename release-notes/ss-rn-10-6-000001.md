## Enhancements

Enhanced the Secret Server Login Assist plugin for Chrome browsers. Changed the mechanism that displays the Login Assist icon in the password field so that it is not obscured by other visible elements of the page. This update also reduced the size of the Login Assist downloaded package.

## Bug Fixes

- Moving dependencies into groups more than once caused a JavaScript error. Fixed a bug where a JavaScript "page unresponsive" error occurred after editing many dependencies without leaving or reloading the page. To resolve this issue, we fixed a memory leak that slowed the page down and caused the error.
- Converting a single Unix Account (SSH Key Rotation) template to the same template type incorrectly populated the Private Key and Public Key File Type drop-down lists. Bulk operations doing the same thing worked fine. Fixed. Note: The customer needed the source and destination templates to be the same because they had a custom template based on it.
- Issues appeared with editing and creating administration scripts after upgrading from Secret Server 9.1.000001 to 10.5.000003. Fixed issue when upgrading from versions 9.1.000001 or earlier.

This occurred on the Discovery Rules Alert page when an SMTP server was configured for the instance.

Decryption was incorrectly attempting to use the HSM, rather than the master, key for decryption.

Bulk operations doing the same thing worked fine. Fixed. Note: The customer needed the source and destination templates to be the same because they had a custom template based on it.

- Assigning secret permissions to a group threw a secret template permissions "Bad Request" error in Secret Server 10.6. Fixed. Attempting to remove permissions from the Everyone group or assigning permissions to a different group threw the error. Assigning permissions to individual users still worked; however, any group-based assignment failed.

Fixed an issue where the Display option was visible in the preview pane of the new UI when a user had Edit permissions on a secret, even with the Hide Launcher Password setting enabled. The password itself was never shown to users who did not have Edit permissions, so there was not a security issue.
- Web services session expired after upgrading to Secret Server 10.6. Fixed issue where the Session Timeout for Webservices setting was overridden by the Allow Remember Me setting for REST and SOAP sessions.
