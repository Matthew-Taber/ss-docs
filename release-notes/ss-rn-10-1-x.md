# Secret Server Release Notes 10.1.x

 ## Release Notes 10.1.000023

*Release Date: 2/22/2017*

 ### Enhancements

- Added additional actions to user audit for when 2-factor is changed on the user.

- Added status icon to the Heartbeat field on Secrets. Going forward new Heartbeat and Password Change errors can be viewed in a Secret's audit log for quicker diagnosis and reporting. Note that these error messages are not backfilled so only new errors will show in the log going forward.

- Added support for multiple domain controller IP addresses in the domain field of an Active Directory Secret for cases when the domain name isn't resolvable for heartbeat and password changing.

- Updated behavior in the SOAP API for disabling Check Out on Secrets that are currently checked out to match bulk operations behavior. A Secret Owner can now call SetCheckOutEnabled to turn off check out on a currently checked out Secret.

- Added a new role permission for creating application user accounts.

- SOAP API â€“ Added new method for GetReport to get report data via the API
