# Step 12: Secret Access and Workflow

Sometimes, depending on your scenario, you want to add extra protections to highly sensitive secrets. SS has a access request and workflow features:

- [Secret Check-Outs](../../secret-checkout/index.md): Grant access to a single user

- [Basic Secret-Access Requests](../../access-requests/index.md): Require approval prior to accessing a secret for a defined time period

- [Secret Check-Outs](../../secret-checkout/index.md): Grant access to a single user

- [Secret DoubleLocks](../../secret-doublelocks/index.md): Add another security layer by encrypting secret data with a supplemental custom encryption key that is only accessible with an additional password, regardless of regular permissions.
