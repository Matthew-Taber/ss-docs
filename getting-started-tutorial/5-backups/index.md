# Step 5: Backups

Configure backups to avoid losing your data. SS provides the option to automatically take a backup on the interval you specify, sending the backups to a local or network location. There are two components of an entire backup of Secret Server: the Web application files and the database. Find these settings by selecting **Backup** from the **Admin** menu. See [Backup and Disaster Recovery](../..//backup-and-disaster-recovery/index.md) for more information.

To configure the backup paths, see [Backup Configuration File Path Settings](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?BackupDatabaseFilePath) (KB).

> **Note**   The file paths configured on this page by default need to be either changed or created on each server that the SS application and database reside on.
