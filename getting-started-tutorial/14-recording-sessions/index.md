# Step 14: Recording Sessions

Session recording provides an additional level of security by recording a user's actions after a launcher is used. Session recording works for any launcher, including PuTTY and SSH, Windows Remote Desktop, Microsoft SQL Management Studio, and custom executables. The resulting movie is viewable from the secret audit. There are two types of session recording:

- [Basic Session Recording](../../session-recording/index.md)
- [Advanced Session Recording](../../session-recording/index.md)
