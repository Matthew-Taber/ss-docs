# 14. Recording Sessions

Session recording provides an additional level of security by recording a user's actions after a launcher is used. Session recording works for any launcher, including PuTTY and SSH, Windows Remote Desktop, Microsoft SQL Management Studio, and custom executables. The resulting movie is viewable from the secret audit. Detailed information on supported codecs can be found in [Session Recording](#Session-Recording). There are two types of session recording:

- [Basic Session Recording](#basic-session-recording)
- [Advanced Session Recording](#Advanced-session-recording)
