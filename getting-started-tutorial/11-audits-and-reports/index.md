# 11. Audits and Reports

Before running reports and audits, you must create something to report onâ€”to that end:

- Import a few accounts or create secrets manually
- Rotate passwords a few times
- View a couple of your secrets

This generates enough audit logs to provide meaningful outputs in your reports:

- Security Hardening Report
- What secrets have been accessed
- What secrets failed heartbeat
- Failed login attempts
- Secret activity

See [List of Built-In Reports](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/List-of-built-in-Reports) (KB) for the most up-to-date list of reports included.
