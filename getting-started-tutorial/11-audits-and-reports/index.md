# Step 11: Audits and Reports

Before running reports and audits, you must create something to report onâ€”to that end:

- Import a few accounts or create secrets manually

- Rotate passwords a few times

- View a couple of your secrets

This generates enough audit logs to provide meaningful outputs in your reports:

- Security Hardening Report

- What secrets have been accessed

- What secrets failed heartbeat

- Failed login attempts

- Secret activity

See [List of Built-In Reports](../../reports/built-in-reports/index.md) for the most up-to-date list of reports included.

For details on using reports, see:
