Secret Server (SS) is a powerful application with many facets. As such, approaching it for the first time can be daunting. To counter that, we created this section, which is an introductory guided tutorial, for new users. The tutorial suggest an order to learn topics and points to specific sections of documentation for details.

>**Important:** This tutorial is oriented toward system administrators and other technical professionals. We recommend that non-technical users start with our [End User Guide](../secret-server-end-user-guide/index.md). For Secret Server Cloud, see the [Secret Server Cloud Quick Start](../secret-server-cloud/quick-start/index.md).
