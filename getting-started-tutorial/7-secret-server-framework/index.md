# Step 7: Secret Server Framework

To try out SS, you must have folders, roles, users, and secrets to operate on:

1. Setup some folders and roles: We encourage is for you to setup a folder structure and a few roles. The folder structure is how you will keep your secrets organized, and provide access to shared secrets. Additionally, roles ensure you are able to control access to different parts of SS and assign permissions to view certain folders and secrets. See [Secret Folders](../../secret-folders/index.md) and [Roles](../../roles/index.md).

1. Add users if you have not already from AD. See [Creating Users](#creating-users) and [Creating User Groups](#creating-user-groups).

1. Add an Active Directory or other secrets. If you plan on using discovery, the account will also need permissions to scan computers on the network for accounts. See [Managing Secrets](../../secret-management/index.md).
