> **Note:** You cannot make any changes to the behavior of a workflow template if there are active requests using that template without cancelling those requests. An active request is any unexpired request that has not been approved, denied, or canceled by the user. If you do make an alteration, any requests are canceled and those affected are notified by email so they can resubmit their requests. Any user editing the template is notified when he or she tries to save changes on the canceled request.
