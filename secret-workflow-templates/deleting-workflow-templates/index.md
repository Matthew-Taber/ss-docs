# Deleting Workflows

To delete a workflow:

1. Go to **Admin > Workflows**. The Workflows page appears:

   ![image-20210310100523134](../accessing-the-workflow-designer/images/image-20210310100523134.png)

   The page lists all active workflows.

1. (Optional) Click to enable the **Show Inactive** toggle button, under the **Create Workflow** button, to show both active and inactive templates. When the toggle button is disabled, it only shows active workflows.

1. Click the workflow to delete in the list to go to the designer page for that workflow (not shown).

1. Click the **Delete** button. A confirmation popup page appears.

1. Click the **Yes, Delete** button.

> **Note:** Because workflows based on the template may still be in play, the template is not completely deleted. Instead, it is inactivated. You can reactivate the template later. See [Accessing the Workflow Designer](../accessing-the-workflow-designer/index.md).
