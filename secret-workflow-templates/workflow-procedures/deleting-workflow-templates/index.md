1. Click the workflow template you want to copy in the **Workflow Templates** table. That template appears:

1. Click the **Delete** button. A confirmation popup page appears.

1. Click the **Yes, Delete** button.

> **Note:** Because workflows based on the template may still be in play, the template is not completely deleted. Instead, it is inactivated. You can reactivate the template later. See [Accessing the Workflow Designer](#accessing-the-workflow-designer)."
