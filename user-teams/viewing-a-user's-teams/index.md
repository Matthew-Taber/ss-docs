1. Navigate to **Admin \> See All**. The Administration page appears:

1. Type and then click **Users** in the search text box. The View User page appears:

   ![image-20191209102452202](images/image-20191209102452202.png)

   You can see if the user belongs to a team, and if so, what teams the user belongs to. If the Restricted by Team line says _No_, it means the user has been granted the Unrestricted by Teams permission, which means the user can view all users, groups, and sites.
