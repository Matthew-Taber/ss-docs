# Configuring Teams Management

To set up SS to use the team management feature:

1. Create a new role called _Team Limited User_.

1. Assign all permissions of the standard user role except _Unrestricted by Teams_.

1. Assign users you want restricted by teams this role.

1. Remove the User role from their account.

> **Note:** If you want all new users restricted by team, you can configure SS to assign the Team Limited User role as the default upon creation of a new user.
