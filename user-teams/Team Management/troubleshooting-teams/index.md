# Troubleshooting Teams

Users can view other users not in their teams if that user already had a connection, such as a shared secret, with the other user prior to setting up the team restrictions.

The API does not restrict who can be assigned if they use the known group ID of a user or group not in their team. This is designed so secret permissions can be saved across teams without removing the permissions of another team.
