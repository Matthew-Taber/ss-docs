# Secret Server Cloud IP Address Change for March to May 2021

Thycotic is making infrastructure upgrades to Secret Server Cloud (SSC) over the next few weeks. As part of this work, the IP addresses for SSC will change. Your SSC subdomain will not change.

If you are using outbound IP address filtering to limit connections from your network infrastructure to SSC you may need to update your firewall rules to include the new IP addresses.

The new IP addresses and dates when the changes will occur are listed below for each SSC region. Two dates are listed for each region because the upgrade work will be performed over multiple weekends. We advise that you make changes before the earlier date.
