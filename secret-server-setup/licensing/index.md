### Understanding Licenses

SS's licensing model allows for scalability and enhanced core functionality in the form of edition enhancements (Professional, Premium Edition) and user packs. Licenses can be purchased for these items as follows:

- **Users:** SS ships with one free single user. Additional user licenses can be purchased through <https://thycotic.com> to expand an installation.

- **Support:** Support licenses allow installed instances of SS to receive all software updates. The number of support licenses and user licenses must be equivalent in order to be eligible for upgrades.

> **Note:** Users must be supported in order to receive technical assistance from the SS support team.

After installation, the first thing we recommend doing is entering your licenses. You can do this in the Getting Started Wizard or from the Licenses Administration page (instructions below). This not only allows you to add more users but also enables additional features in SS. 

For the Express edition, you have one license to enter. For Professional edition and higher, you have, at minimum:

- An edition license
- A user license
- A support license. 

If you purchased additional licenses for sites or distributed engines, you may have more licenses to add.

> **Note**:  You will not have a support license if you have purchased the installed edition of SS but did not purchase support or upgrade protection.

### Activating Licenses

All non-evaluation licenses require activation after install. Activation is per license and Web server combination. Therefore, if you bring up a new Web server, it needs activation, even if your previous Web server was already activated. After installing each license, you are prompted to activate. Follow the on-screen prompts for online or offline activation. The activation process gathers the name, email, and phone number of the individual activating for internal purposes only. No other personal information is be sent to Thycotic.

To activate licenses:

1. Go to **Admin \> Licenses**.
2. Click the **Install New License** button.
3. Type the **License Name** and **License Key** for one of the licenses that you received from your account manager.
4. Click the **Save** button.
5. If you have another license to add, click **Add Another License**.
6. When you have added all licenses, click **License Activation**.
7. Enter your name, email address, and phone number, then click the **Activate** button. If your server does not have outbound network access, click **Activate Offline** instead.

> **Note:**  For more information about license activation, see [License Activation](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?WhatIsActivation) (KB).

### Installing New Licenses

Once a license is obtained, it can be installed by copying the license name and code into the corresponding text-entry fields to a new license page. To access this page:

1. Select **Licenses** from the **Administration** menu.

2. Click **Install New License**.

### Converting from Trial Licenses

If you previously had evaluation licenses and recently purchased SS, you need to remove all evaluation licenses and install your purchased licenses. Normal trial licenses expire one month after issue. If the new licenses are not installed, users see "License has expired" error messages.

### Licensing Limited Mode

If you fail to activate, your system is be placed in limited mode, which prevents the following actions:

- AD sync

- Creating and editing secrets

- Importing secrets

- Manual RPC

- Web services (mobile applications)
