## Understanding Licenses

The Secret Server licensing model allows for scalability and enhanced core functionality in the form of edition enhancements (Professional, Premium Edition) and user packs. Licenses can be purchased for these items as follows:

- **Users:** Secret Server ships with one free license for a single user. Additional user licenses can be purchased through <https://thycotic.com>.
- **Support:** Support licenses allow you to receive receive technical assistance from the Secret Server support team, and  software updates for installed versions of Secret Server. To be eligible for updates, the number of support licenses and user licenses must match.

After installation is complete, you need to enter your licenses using the Getting Started Wizard or from the Licenses Administration page. Entering your licenses allows you to add more users and enables additional features in Secret Server. 

>**Note**: For more information, see [Adding, Activating, Converting, and Deleting Licenses](adding-activating-deleting-licenses/index.md).

For the Express edition, you have one license to enter. For Professional edition and higher, you have, at minimum:

- An edition license
- A user license
- A support license

If you purchased additional licenses for sites or distributed engines, you may have more licenses to add.

> **Note**: If you have purchased the installed edition of Secret Server but did not purchase support or upgrade protection, you will not have a support license.

## Activating Licenses

After entering your license information, you must activate your (non-evaluation) licenses. For more information, see [Adding, Activating, Converting, and Deleting Licenses](adding-activating-deleting-licenses/index.md) and the [License Activation FAQ](../../secret-server-setup/licensing/licensing-faq/index.md).

## Licensing Limited Mode

If you fail to activate your licenses, your system is placed in limited mode, which prevents the following actions:

- AD sync
- Creating and editing secrets
- Importing secrets
- Creating and editing secrets
- Web services (mobile applications)
