Secret templates are used to create secrets and allow customization of the format and content of secrets to meet company needs and standards. Examples include: Local Administrator Account, SQL Server Account, Oracle Account, Credit Card and Web Password. Templates can contain passwords, usernames, notes, uploaded files, and drop-down list values. New Secret templates can be created, and all existing templates can be modified.
