# Secret Template List Fields

## Overview

==With secret template list fields, administrators can create new lists that can be shared by multiple secrets. Clicking on an existing list goes to the details page for that list where the user can set the list’s name,==
==description, and the options available in the list. Options can be grouped by category, so a list of machines might have the machines categorized by function, such as “Web Server,”==
==“Database Server,” etc., or by location such as “London,” “New York,” “Tokyo,” etc. Categories==
==are optional but when used the list will be displayed on the secret and on the launcher dialog==
==with the options sorted alphabetically within categories (also sorted alphabetically). Options==
==can be duplicated in multiple categories and will show up in each one. Categories can make==
==use of very large lists easier for users. In addition to manually adding categories and options,==
==the user can upload a file containing the list options. This can be either a list of options, one==
==option per line, or a list of comma-delimited values in the format option,category with==
==one combination per line. Files can also combine these formats, and any line without a==
==comma will be treated as a categoryless option.==
