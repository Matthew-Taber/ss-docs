# Activating and Deactivating Templates

If a template is no longer relevant or outdated, it can be inactivated. This can be done from the specific template's Secret Template Edit page.

Templates can also be inactivated in bulk from the Manage Secret Templates page. Click the **Active Templates** button to navigate to the Set Active Secret Templates page. This screen displays all the secret templates in SS. Each secret template can be set as active or inactive. Once the secret templates are chosen as active or inactive, then saving changes brings the secret templates into effect immediately. Inactivating a secret template does not inactivate any secrets using that secret templateâ€”those secrets still exist, but users are not able to create new secrets using an inactivated secret template.
