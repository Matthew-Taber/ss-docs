   1. Go through each list and select the target text-entry field for each source text-entry field on your secret.

The Convert Template button is only available to users and groups with the "Owner" permission to the secret.

> **Note:** To preserve audit data, when a secret is converted from one type to another, the old secret is deleted, and a new secret is created. An admin can view old secret by searching for deleted secrets on the dashboard. A user needs "Add Secret," "Edit Secret," "Delete Secret," and "Own Secret" role permissions in order to convert a secret to a new template.
