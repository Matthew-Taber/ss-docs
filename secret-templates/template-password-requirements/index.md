# Template Password Requirements

> **Note:** Please click the table of contents on the left to see any sub-pages to this one. Click the table of contents on the right to see headings on this page.

Set requirements on a password text-entry field to validate user-entered passwords or make auto-generated passwords conform to set specifications.

A password requirement is made up of a minimum and maximum length, a set of characters, and optional rules such as "At least three upper-case characters" or "The first character must be lower-case". The default password requirement is 12 characters from the default character set, with at least one upper-case, lower-case, numeric, and symbol character.

Create or edit password requirements by clicking the **Password Requirements** button on the **Administration > Secret Templates** page.

Click the **Character Sets** button next to the Password Requirements button to create or delete character sets.
