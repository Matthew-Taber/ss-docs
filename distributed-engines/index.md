# Distributed Engines

Out of the box, SS performs all functions from the web server it is installed on, however, specific features can be routed through a distributed engine. For example, synchronize and authenticate AD users can be done in SS via your local site or from distributed engine (DE).

You can install a DE in a remote site and allow it to operate many functions. Communication with Secret Server Cloud also requires the distributed engine to be installed.
