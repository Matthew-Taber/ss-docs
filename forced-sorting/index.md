# Forced Sorting

The priority tag specifies the order of the contents files in the TOC.

The sorting order is in relationship to the parent folder and peers. The peers can be either .md files on the same level or the index.md files in any child folders of the parent.

| Parent | Peer | Child |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| House has | Doors | |
| | Windows | |
| | Rooms, that have | Doors |
| | | Windows |
| | | Furniture |
| | Floors, which have | Stairs |
