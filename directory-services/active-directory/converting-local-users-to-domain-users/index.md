# Converting Local Users to Domain Users

Local users can be converted to a domain user in a one-way irreversible process. This feature helps existing customers with extensive groups and permissions setup for a local user that they want to convert to an Active Directory user. The page can be accessed on the **Administration > Users** page by clicking the **Migrate to AD** button. For the conversion to work, the domain user must not exist within SS. The username is changed to match the domain user throughout the system.
