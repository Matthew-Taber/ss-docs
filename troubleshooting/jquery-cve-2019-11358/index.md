# Notice: jQuery CVE-2019-11358

## Relevance

This Thycotic **technical issue** knowledge base article is relevant to:

- Product(s): Secret Server using jQuery 3.2.1
- Version(s): 10.7
- Edition(s): All

## Technical Issue

Secret Server 10.7 uses jQuery 3.2.1, which is listed as vulnerable to the jQuery CVE-2019-11358 security issue on the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list.](https://cve.mitre.org/) 

## Resolution

Thycotic removed the jQuery vulnerability from Secret Serverâ€™s copy of jQuery v3.2.1 by applying a patch (see [Related Articles and Resources](#related-articles-and-resources)). 

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to  `https://<your_secret_server_URL>/assets/libs/jquery-3.2.1.js`
1. Open the file in a text editor.
1. Search for the string `proto` in the code:
...
   ``` javascript
   // Prevent Object.prototype pollution
   // Prevent never-ending loop
   if ( name === "__proto__" || target === copy ) {
   continue;
   }
   ```

1. If the string appears, the patch has been applied.
