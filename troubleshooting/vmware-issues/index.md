# VMware Issues

Secret Server supports operating systems in a VMware virtual machine environment in an identical manner as it runs on any other major x86-based systems without initially requiring reproduction of issues on native hardware. Should Thycotic Support suspect  that the virtualization layer is the root cause of an incident, you must contact VMware support  provider to resolve the VMware issue. While Thycotic products are expected to function properly in a VMware virtual environment, there may be performance implications that can invalidate SS sizing and recommendations.
