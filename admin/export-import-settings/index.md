## JSON Export File

In addition to the setting categories, here are a few components of the JSON export file that you should be aware of.

### External Instance ID

`"externalInstanceId": "95931fb9-02b0-47a5-a59d-69d6543a192d",`

The external instance ID is an identifier for the SS instance the settings were exported from. If you change this ID, SS will assume the export came from another database and will insert new records for the ticket system (TicketSystemId)  or SAML (Identity Providersâ€”IdentityProviderId) categories. To add a new record in the same instance, set the ID to 0 and it will be treated as a new item.

### Configuration Version

` "configurationVersion": "1.0.0",`

This is the configuration version the settings were exported from. In there future when other settings are added, it will help SS determine which settings are available and which are not in the database.

## JSON Import File

In the UI, the exported JSON file can be easily modified and used as the import JSON file. For the API, the exported JSON must be added to the data object. Then manually update the desired filter category load to true to import.

## API Calls Filter

Secret Server has settings import/export endpoints for the API to manipulate. Opening Postman and going to **secretserversettings \> export \> GET Get Secret Server Settings**, you would see:

![image-20210303143554262](images/image-20210303143554262.png)

Looking at the query parameters for that endpoint, we see:

![image-20210316131850584](images/image-20210316131850584.png)

The keys are equivalent to those on the user interface or those in the JSON file.

The `loadAll` key tells SS to update all the available settings. These include application settings, launcher settings, protocol handler settings, permission options, user experience settings, and user interface settings.

If you click the **Body** tab below, you can see what JSON code represents the key you chose for the export:

![image-20210316132057512](images/image-20210316132057512.png)

When using the POST Import Secret Server Settings command, you will see a filter object at the bottom of the code stipulating what to update:

![image-20210316132310262](images/image-20210316132310262.png)

For example, if you set `loadApplicationSettings` to `true`, only the application settings are updated, assuming the objects stipulated were sent with the request. Similarly, included objects that are disallowed by the filter are ignored.

To make a GET call to update a single setting:

1. Import the category it belongs to. For example, if you want to update `apiSessionTimeoutUnlimited` to `true`, you would copy the entire `applicationSettings` result (the category and all of its settings).

1. For the POST Import Secret Server Settings call, remove the settings in the data section, leaving the filter section as is:

   ![image-20210316134108377](images/image-20210316134108377.png)

1. Paste the settings you copied earlier in its place.

1. Change the `apiSessionTimeoutUnlimited` setting to `true`:

   ![image-20210316134225542](images/image-20210316134225542.png)

1. Scroll down to the filter section and remove the filters you do not want to update. Alternatively, you can replace all the `<boolean>` settings with `false` for the filters you do not want.

1. If you want to set a nullable field back to null, set the dirty flag and the value to null. For example:

   ```json
   "siteId": {
   
     "dirty": "true",
   
     "value": null
   
   }
   ```

1. Click the **Send** button. If all goes well, Postman will return the updated category object:

   ![image-20210316134359679](images/image-20210316134359679.png)

   > **Note:** In this example, we copied the whole data object, but you do not have to. For a quick update, you can Import with just the settings you want to update. Anything not sent is ignored. This is the reason a nullable setting has to be explicitly set to null, along with setting the dirty flagâ€”everything set to null is ignored, the same as if you did not send the setting at all.

1. If something went wrong, you will see an error section at the bottom of the results:

   ![image-20210303162859125](images/image-20210303162859125.png)

## Audits

An audit is recorded for each setting category that was exported or imported by user. The individual setting audits can be viewed on the Configuration Audit page.

**Figure:**  Audits on the Export / Import page:

![image-20210302100746575](images/image-20210302100746575.png)

If there are errors, a system log entry will also be saved with details:

- Email
- Login
- Security
- Ticket System
- SAML - Completed with errors

## Events

When SS settings are exported or imported, an SECRETSERVERSETTINGS event is  logged.

## Logs

When Secret Server settings are exported or imported or validation errors occur, a new log entry will appear in the `SS.log` file.

> **Note:** `<USERName>` and `<USERID>` are replaced with your values. The items in the parentheses are the errant category settings.

### System Logs or CEF Example

`<USERNAME> (<USERID>) - Secret Server Settings Import - Failed to import SAML for the following reason(s): TicketSystem=Only one ticket system can be default. (IsDefault);SAML=Identity Provider Id was not found in the database. Check that it was not modified after export. (IdentityProviderId)`

### SS.log Examples

- `ERROR Thycotic.Logging.ILogWriter - <USERNAME> (<USERID>) - Secret Server Settings Import - Failed to import SAML for the following reason(s): TicketSystem=Only one ticket system can be default. (IsDefault);SAML=Identity Provider Id was not found in the database. Check that it was not modified after export. (IdentityProviderId)`
- `ERROR Thycotic.Logging.ILogWriter - <USERNAME> (<USERID>) - Secret Server Settings Import - Failed to import some settings due to the following reason(s): Security=Access Denied;Login=Insufficient permissions to edit Radius settings. (Radius),Insufficient permissions to edit Thycotic One or OpenId settings. (OpenIdConnect),Insufficient permissions to edit Duo settings. (Duo);TicketSystem=Only one ticket system can be default. (IsDefault);SAML=Access Denied`

## Errors and Resolutions

| **Sample Error**                                             | **Resolution**                                               |

| SAML=Access Denied                                           | Need Administer Configuration SAML permission to update SAML settings. |
| SAML=Identity Provider Id was not found in the database. Check that it was not modified after export. (IdentityProviderId) | For SAML, the IdentityProviderId provided in the import file was not found in the database. If intending to add a new one, set this to 0. |
| TicketSystem=Only one ticket system can be default. (IsDefault) | For TicketSystem, IsDefault is set to true when there is already one set to true in the database. If intending to set it to true, set the other one to false. |
| Insufficient permissions to edit Radius settings. (Radius) Insufficient permissions to edit Duo settings. (Duo) | Need Administer Configuration Two Factor permission to update Radius or Duo settings. |
| Insufficient permissions to edit Thycotic One or OpenId settings. (OpenIdConnect) | Need Administer OpenID Connect permission to update Open ID Connect settings. |
