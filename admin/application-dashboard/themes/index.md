## Overview

By default, SS is set to a default theme unless specified within the Configuration settings. SS comes with three other bundled themes: Blue, Dark, and Green. The default theme can be set at **Administration > Configuration** on the general tab. Theming differences can be allowed by individual users with the **Allow User to Select Themes** permission.
