# Themes

## Overview

By default, SS is set to a default theme unless specified within the Configuration settings. SS comes with three other bundled themes: Blue, Dark, and Green. The default theme can be set at **Administration > Configuration** on the general tab. Theming differences can be allowed by individual users with the **Allow User to Select Themes** permission.

## Choosing Themes

1. Click your user icon in the top right of the dashboard and select **Account Settings**.
2. Ensure the **General** tab is selected.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Click the **My Theme** dropdown list to select the theme. Your choices are:
   - Secret Server Classic - Blue
   - Secret Server Classic - Dark
   - Secret Server Classic - Default
   - Secret Server Classic - Gray
   - Secret Server Classic - Green
   - Secret Server (New)
5. Click the **Color Mode** dropdown list to select the color mode (default, light, or dark) when **My Theme** is set to **Secret Server (New)**.

> **Note:** The color mode only applies to Secret Server (New). If you change it while in one of the classic themes, nothing seems to happen; however, when you switch to Secret Server (New), the color mode you chose applies.
