# Enabling Secret Server Discovery

1. On the **Administration** menu click **Discovery**, and then click **Edit**.

1. Select the **Enable Discovery** check box.

1. Fill in the **Synchronization Interval for Discovery** text-entry fields for days, hours, or minutes. This determines how often Discovery runs.

   > **Note:** See the “Discovery Best Practices Guide” for details about the other controls.

1. Change the **Days to Keep Operational Logs** text box to set the period to keep discovery-related logs that might contain PII. SS automatically deletes logs older than that (in days).

1. Click **Save**.
