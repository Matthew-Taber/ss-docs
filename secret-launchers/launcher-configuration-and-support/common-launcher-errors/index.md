# Common Launcher Errors

Two of the most common launcher errors:

- **The process (process name) was not found:** The application has not been installed on the machine. If the application was installed, the program folder needs to be added to the path.

- **The stub received bad data (1783):** The process is set to launch as the credentials of the secret but the username or domain is not correct on the secret or the client machine cannot find the user or domain credentials specified.
