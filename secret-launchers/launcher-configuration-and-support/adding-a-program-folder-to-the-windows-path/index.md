1. In the Properties window, click Advanced System Settings.

1. On the **Advanced** tab, click the **Environment Variables** button.

1. In the **System Variables** section scroll to **Path**.

1. Click **Edit** then at the very end of the text box, paste the full path to the folder where the program file is located, but make sure not to replace any existing entries. The list is semi-colon separated.
