# Configuring SSH Proxies for Launchers

Launchers using an SSH connection can alternatively use SS as a proxy rather than the launcher connecting directly to the target system from the machine it is being launched from. When proxying is enabled, all RD sessions are routed through SS. In SS Cloud, the Distributed Engine service also supports acting as a proxy for session launchers for greater network flexibility and offloading connections from the SS instance.

   The **SSH Proxy Settings** are:

    - **Enable Proxy:** Enable or disable SSH proxying.
    - **Enable SSH Tunneling:** SSH Tunneling allows Remote Desktop Sessions to be proxied using the same proxy configuration settings.
    - **Proxy New secrets By Default:** This setting determines whether newly created secrets have their SSH proxy setting enabled; secret policy takes precedence over this default.

 - **SSH Proxy Port:** The default port to apply to all connections, unless another port is assigned to a specific connection.

   - **SSH Banner:** Users connecting through SS see this text banner on the SSH client.
   - **SSH Proxy Private Key:** The SS SSH private key, this can be generated using the **Generate New SSH Key** button.
   - **Enable Inactivity Timeout:** Enable or disable closing the session if there is inactivity for a defined number of seconds. When enabled, a **Timeout (seconds)** text box appears.

 - **Days to Keep Operational Logs**: Sets the period to keep SSH-proxy-related logs that might contain PII. SS automatically deletes logs older than that (in days).

   The **SSH Terminal Settings** are:

   - **Enable Inactivity Timeout:** Enable or disable closing the SSH terminal session if there is inactivity for a defined number of seconds. When enabled, a **Timeout (seconds)** text box appears.

   - **Enable Terminal:**  Enable or disable the SSH terminal.

   - **SSH Terminal Banner:** The text banner you want displayed when somebody opens an SSH terminal session.

   > **Note:** For details about connecting to SS with an SSH terminal, see the [SSH Terminal Administration Guide](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/SS-ADM-EXT-SSH-Terminal).

   > **Note:** To manipulate a secret via an SSH terminal, the secretâ€™s proxy setting must be enabled, and the secret must be shared with the authenticated terminal user.

   The **Nodes** settings are:

    - **Machine Name:** The public host name of the node server.

    - **SSH Public IP Address of Nodes:** The public IP that the client launcher connects to. In most cases, this can be the same as the SSH bind address;  however, there may be cases where the public IP or host differs from the private IP that SS should bind to, such as NAT or an Amazon EC2 instance.

    The **Sites** settings are:

    - **Proxy Enabled:** Enable or disable SSH proxying for a specific site.

    - **Site Name:** Site name or ID.

    - **SSH Port:** The port SS listens on. The default is 22.

    The **Engines** settings are:

    - **Friendly Name:** Human readable site name or ID.
    - **Hostname/IP Address:** The public hostname or IP that the client launcher connects to. In most cases this can be the same as the SSH Bind Address, however there may be cases where the public IP or host differs than the private IP that SS should bind to, such as NAT or an Amazon EC2 instance.
    - **SSH Bind Address:** The IP Address of the network adapter that the SS SSH listener should bind to. This should not be localhost or 127.0.0.1\. If you are not sure which bind IP Address to use, you may use 0.0.0.0, which binds to all IPv4 interfaces on the machine.

   > **Note:** The flow for when a user proxies through a Distributed Engine, rather than SS, is the same, except that rather than the user's session launcher connecting to the public host on the node, it connects to the public host of an engine that is part of a site the secret is assigned to.
