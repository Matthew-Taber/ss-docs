# Secret Launchers

## Introduction

A secret _launcher_ opens a connection to the remote computer or device or logs into a website using the secret's credentials directly from the Web page. While this provides a convenient method of opening RDP and PuTTy connections, it also circumvents users being required to know their passwords. A user can still gain access to a needed machine, but it is not required to view or copy the password out of SS. A Web launcher automatically logs into websites using the client's browser.
