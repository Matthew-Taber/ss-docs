# Configuring Web Launchers for Secrets

Once enabled on the template, a Web launcher needs to be configured for the secret. Each website login is unique and requires the secret text-entry fields to be mapped to the form controls. For a new secret the Launcher icon appears and clicking on it takes the user to a configuration screen. The user can also view and access the configuration screen from the Launcher tab. Depending on whether other secrets with the same website have been configured, the user has different options.

> **Note:** Configuring the Secret for use with the Web Launcher requires the user to have Owner permission on the Secret.

First, there is the option of downloading the setting from Thycotic.com. When the Configure Web Launcher page is loaded, SS checks online at Thycotic.com for pre-approved matching websites. If any are found, they are downloaded and made available to pick from in the dropdown list.

> **Note:** This functionality can be disabled in SS in the Configuration Settings.

The list displays all downloaded configurations and other secrets' configuration for the same domain that the user has permission to view. Select one from the list and click **Next** to create a copy of the settings for the secret.

There is also an option to create a configuration that allows the Web launcher to be used on most websites and not rely on published configuration settings. To use this, select the last item in the dropdown list and click **Next**. The next section discusses the create process.
