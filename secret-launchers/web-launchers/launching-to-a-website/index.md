# Launching to a Website

The Web launcher can be used by clicking the Launcher icon on the Secret View page. The Web launcher opens a new window in the browser, which attempts to login to the site using the credentials on the secret. The launcher can also be used with the Test Launcher button on the Launcher tab. Testing the Launcher creates a dialog to offer troubleshooting help and means to upload the configuration to Thycotic.com. The uploaded configuration is reviewed and published by Thycotic for all SS customers to use with the check online feature. No secret or identifiable information is uploaded to Thycotic.com. Only the website URL and control names are sent.
