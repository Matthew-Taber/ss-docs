> **Note:** Please click the table of contents on the left to see any sub-pages to this one.

Web launchers are a separate login method from the Web password filler and provide a convenient click to automatically log on simpler websites. Web launchers do not work on complex login pages that rely on JavaScript. For those login pages, use the bookmarklet or browser extension for the Web password filler. By default, Web launchers are enabled on the Web Password Secret template, but they can be enabled on custom templates as well, as described in [Enabling Launchers](../enabling-launchers/index.md).
