# Built-In Launcher Types

SS launchers, supported by protocol handlers, come in three primary types:

- **Remote Desktop:** Launches a Windows Remote Desktop session and automatically authenticates the user to the machine.

- **PuTTY:** Opens a PuTTY session and authenticates the user to a Unix system.

- **Web Password Filler:** Uses a bookmarklet or a Chrome extension to automatically log the user into a website with secret credentials.

- **Web Launcher:** An alternative method to automatically log on websites. See [Web Launchers](../web-launchers/index.md).
