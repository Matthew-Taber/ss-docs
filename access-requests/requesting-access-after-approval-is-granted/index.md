# Requesting Access After Approval Is Granted

To start the request process for access to a secret, the user must simply attempt to view the secret. The user is then sent to the Request page. In there, the user can explain the reason for the request and then click **Request Access** to submit the request.

If a member of the Approval Group either approves or denies the request (see below for details), the requestor is sent an email with the details. If approved, the requestor can access the secret via the link contained in the email.
