# Access Requests

The access request feature allows a secret to require approval prior to accessing the secret. Note the following:

- Establishing a 'Workflow model, the user must request access from the approval group or groups.
- An email is sent to everyone in the approval groups, notifying them of the request.
- The request can be approved or denied by any members of the approval groups.
- Access is granted for a set time period.
- If **Owners and Approvers also Require Approval** is enabled, then even owners or those in an approval group needs to request access.
