# Automated Sorting

If you want homer to use abc-logic, only set the index.md file on each folder level to priority #1 to always specify the "landing" page for the section/chapter. Use #2 for all contents.md files. However, keep the overall first level TOC order in mind, as you probably want to have Intro, Installation, Getting Started, Main Subject 1, Main Subject 2, etc...
