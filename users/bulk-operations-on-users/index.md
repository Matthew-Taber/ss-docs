# Bulk Operations on Users

Bulk operations on users can also be performed from the **Users** page. Select one or more users using the check boxes beside the **User Name** column, or select all or none by toggling the check box in the header row. Once the appropriate users have been selected, use the Bulk Operation list at the bottom of the grid to select an action. Bulk operations on users currently include enabling or disabling user access, as well as configuring users for email or RADIUS two-factor authentication.
