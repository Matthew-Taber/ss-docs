# Creating Users

To manually create a single user, navigate to **Administration > Users** and click the **Create New** button. On the subsequent page, you can enter the relevant information for a user.

> **Note:** To add many users from your Active Directory setup, you can use Active Directory synchronization (see [Active Directory Synchronization](Active-Directory-Synchronization)).
