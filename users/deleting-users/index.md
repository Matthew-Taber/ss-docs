# Deleting Users

You cannot delete users per se because of auditing requirements; however, deactivating the user from the [User Settings page](../user-settings/index.md) accomplishes the same thing. See [Removing Deactivated User PII](../removing-deactivated-user-pii/index.md) for eliminating all traces of a deactivated user.
