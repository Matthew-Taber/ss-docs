# User Owners

User Administrators can also set another group or user as the *user owner* for a SS local user. User owners can manage and edit just that user. For example, a developer might need to unlock or reset the password for an application account but should not have access to all users. Set **Managed by to User Owners** on a user and then select **Groups** or **Users**. Note that Unlimited Administrator mode can still be used to manage groups with user owners assigned.
