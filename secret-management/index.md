_Secrets_ are individually named sets of sensitive information. Secrets address a broad spectrum of secure data, each type represented and created by a _secret template_. You can centrally manage secret security through sharing settings for each secret. Additionally, using folder structure, you can allow one or more secrets to inherit permissions from their parent folder. All secret text-entry field information is securely encrypted before being stored in the database, including a detailed audit trail for access and history.

> **Note:** You can "favorite" a secret in the main menu by right clicking it.
