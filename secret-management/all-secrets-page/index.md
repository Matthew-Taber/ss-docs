# All Secrets Page

All Secrets is a master table of the secrets stored on SS. It is a one-stop, searchable location for examining the status and properties of secrets. It is a supplement to, not a replacement for, the [secret folder tree](../../secret-folders/index.md). It lists and you can sort by secret template, heartbeat status, sync status, machine, access date, username, and much more.
