# Secret Launcher Tab

The Launcher tab appears for secrets that use either a custom launcher or Web launcher.

If a custom launcher is associated with a secret template, a secret owner can configure associated secrets or a privileged secret to run the launcher process. The associated secret can be tied in to the command line parameters on the custom launcher, and the privileged secret is the identity that kicks off the launcher process.

If a Web launcher is associated with a secret template, the launcher tab displays how the Web launcher is configured for that secret. The following options are available:

- **Edit Fields:** Modify which secret text-entry fields are mapped to the HTML input controls on the target website.

- **Reconfigure Web Launcher:** Reset the Web launcher configuration.

- **Test Launcher:** Test the current Web Launcher configuration.

- **Use Web Password Filler:** Use the Web password filler rather than the Web launcher.

> **Note:** See [Web Launcher](../../../secret-launchers/web-launchers/index.md) for details.
