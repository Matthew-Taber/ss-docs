# Secret Security Tab

The Security tab contains settings that can be enabled to increase security for a secret. The settings listed below may or may not be visible, depending on your configuration settings:

- **Require Check Out:** Only one user at a time has access to a secret. See [Secret Checkout](../../../secret-checkout/index.md) for details.

- **Enable DoubleLock:** User must enter a doubleLock password to decrypt and view a secret.

- **Enable Requires Approval for Access:** Users must request access to view a secret.

- **Require Comment:** Users must enter a comment before being granted access to view the secret. The comment is stored in the audit log for that secret.

- **Enable Session Recording:** Record the Launcher session. This applies to secrets with a launcher associated with the secret template. See [Session Recording](../../../session-recording/index.md).

- **Hide Launcher Password:** Restrict users with View permission from copying passwords to the clipboard or unmasking the password text-entry field of the secret. This applies to secrets with a launcher associated with the secret template.

- **Customize Password Requirement:** Specify a password requirement for each password text-entry field.
