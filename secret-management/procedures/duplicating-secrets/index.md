# Duplicating Secrets

The secret duplication function allows for easier, automatic secret duplication. Any user with the Owner Secret permission on a secret can click to select **Duplicate** in the **Options** dropdown list to create a new secret with information based on the original secret. Secret text-entry field information, launcher settings, secret settings, double locks, email settings, and permissions are copied over. Audit records are written to the source secret and target secret to indicate that a copy operation took place. Currently, file attachments are not copied.
