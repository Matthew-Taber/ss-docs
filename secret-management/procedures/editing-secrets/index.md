# Editing Secrets

> **Note:** If using the Dashboard, see [Secret Server Dashboard](../../../application-administration/application-dashboard/index.md).

To edit a secret:

1. Navigate to the secret's **View** page by searching or drilling down the folder tree.

1. Click the desired tab for the secret configuration.

1. Click the **Edit** **All Fields** link. All text-entry fields become editable.

   > **Note:** The password generator is governed by a password requirement, which is usually set via the secret template. However, you can override the template for this secret and set the requirement to something different in the Password Requirements section of the Security tab after you create the secret.

1. For passwords, you can create a random password with the **Generate** button (on the General tab). This generates a password according to the rules set at the template level (see secret templates for more information about password requirements).

1. Click the **Save** button.
