# Setting Up Password Masking

Password masking prevents over-the-shoulder viewing of your passwords by a casual observer (passwords show as `*********`). For security, the number of asterisks does not relate to the length of the password.

As an administrator, you can force all the secret password text-entry fields in the system when viewed to be masked. To do this, enable the **Force Password Masking** setting in the **Configuration** settings. Only secret text-entry fields marked as a password text-entry field on the secret template is masked.

There is also a user preference setting that forces password masking on all secret password text-entry fields viewed by the user. This Mask passwords when viewing secrets setting is found in the **Profile > Preference** section for each user. If the configuration setting discussed above is enabled, this user preference setting is overridden and cannot be disabled.
