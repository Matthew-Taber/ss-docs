# Overriding the Secret Template's Password Requirements

All secrets inherit a set of password requirements (see [Template Password Requirements](../../../secret-templates/template-password-requirements/index.md)) from their parent secret template. After you create a secret, you can choose to use a different password requirement for this one secret, which leaves other secrets based on the template as they were. To choose a different password requirement for the secret:

1. Navigate to the secret **View** page by searching or drilling down the folder tree.

1. Click the secret to open the secret's page.

1. Click the **Security** tab.

1. Click the **Edit** Link in the **Password Requirements** subsection in the **Other Security** section. The Edit Password popup appears.

1. Click the Password Requirement dropdown list to select the password requirement you desire.

1. Click the **Save** button.
