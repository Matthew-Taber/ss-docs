# Secret Configuration Options

## Common Configuration Options

These are the configuration options that are common to every secret:

- **Convert Template:** Change which template is being used to store and display information in this Secret.
- **Copy Secret:** Create a duplicate copy of the secret, which may also be renamed and modified.
- **Delete:** Delete the secret.
- **Edit:** Edit the secret parameters.
- **Favorite:** Click the star from the Dashboard or check this box on the Secret View page to mark the Secret as a favorite. It then displays in the Favorite Secrets widget.
- **Folder:** Folder location of the secret. The secret inherits permissions of this folder, depending on the Default Secret Permissions setting in the SS Configuration options.
- **Share:** Configure the sharing settings, or permissions, for the secret.
- **View Audit:** View the secret audit log to see which users have accessed the secret and the actions that have been performed.

## Advanced Configuration Options

These are the buttons, fields, and icons that are available for more advanced secrets:

- **Expire Now:** Expire the secret manually.
- **RDP Launcher Icon:** Click to open the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Launcher. See further details in the Launcher section.
- **Run Heartbeat:** Initiate heartbeat, which attempts to verify that the secret credentials can authenticate.
- **Site:** Edit the secret to set the distributed engine site. This determines where password changing, heartbeat, and proxied sessions run from.
