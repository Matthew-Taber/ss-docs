# Setting up Secrets

Once you enable expiration for the template, expiration is also enabled for secrets that were created using that template as well as secrets created in the future. The Expiration tab appears on the Secret View page and requires the user to have Owner permission on the secret. 

To set a custom expiration at the secret level, you adjust the expiration interval for the secret by clicking the **Expiration** tab in the **Secret View** page. There, you can set the secret to expire using the template settings (default), a custom interval, or a specific date in the future.
