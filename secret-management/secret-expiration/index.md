Secret expiration is a core SS feature. Any template can be set to expire within a fixed time interval. For a secret to expire, a text field must be selected as the target of the expiration. For example, a secret template for Active Directory accounts might require a change on the password text field every 90 days. If the password remains unchanged past the length of time specified, that secret has expired and appears in the Expired Secrets panel on either the Dashboard's Expired secrets widget or the Home page.

Secret expiration provides additional security by reminding users when sensitive data requires review. This assists in meeting compliance requirements that mandate certain passwords be regularly changed. When expiration is combined with RPC, SS can completely automate the process of regularly changing entire sets of passwords to meet security needs.
