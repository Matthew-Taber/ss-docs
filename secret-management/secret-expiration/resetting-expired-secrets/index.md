# Resetting Expired Secrets

To reset an expired secret, you must change the text field that has expired and is required to change. For example, if the text field set to expire is the password text field and the current password is "asdf," then a change to "jklh" resets the expiration interval and thus removes the expiration text on the Secret View page.
