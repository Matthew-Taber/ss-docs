# Resetting Expired Secrets

To reset an expired secret, you must change the text field that has expired and is required to change. For example, if the text field set to expire is the password text field and the current password is "asdf," then a change to "jklh" resets the expiration interval and thus removes the expiration text on the Secret View page.

If you do not know which text field is set to expire:

1. Go to the secret template that the secret was created from.

1. Navigate to **Admin > Secret Template**.

1. Select the template.

1. Click the **Edit** button.

1. On the next page, click the **Change** link. In the **Change Required On** text box you can see the text field that is set to expire.
