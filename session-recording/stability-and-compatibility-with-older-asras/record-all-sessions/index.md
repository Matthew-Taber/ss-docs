# Record All Sessions

As of SS SP2, you can configure the ASRA to record all sessions. This causes it to record video and metadata for anyone logging into the server, even when not using SS, including logging into the console. Since these recordings are not tied to any specific secret, you must go to the **Admin > Session Monitoring** page to view them.
