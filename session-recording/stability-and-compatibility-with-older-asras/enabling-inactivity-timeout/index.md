# Enabling Inactivity Timeout

If enabled, if a session appears idle, users are given a five-minute warning that they will be disconnected. A prompt appears that lets them choose to disconnect immediately or to continue the session. If no response is received, the session is disconnected five minutes later.

**Note:** This feature was added in SS SP2 and is currently only supported in the Windows protocol handler (not Mac).
