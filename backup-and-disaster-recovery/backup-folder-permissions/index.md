# Backup Folder Permissions

From the Backup Administration page, specify the correct directory paths for the IIS SS file directory and the database backups to be stored. The backup path must be local to the server where the SS database or file directory exists. The directories must also have the proper permissions to allow SS to automatically store backups at those locations. The account that requires permission is displayed as an alert on the Backup page.
