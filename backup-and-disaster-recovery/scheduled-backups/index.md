# Scheduled Backups

There are numerous options to consider when backing up SS. Backups can be scheduled to run on a specific time interval. To prevent the directory from growing too large, the number of backups to keep can be defined as well. Depending on size constraints or preferences of the DBA, the database backup can either truncate the transaction log or keep it intact. The additional schedule settings are available when "Enable Schedule Backup" is enabled, and the view page indicates the time and date of the next scheduled backup.
