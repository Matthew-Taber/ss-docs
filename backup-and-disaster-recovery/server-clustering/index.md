# Server Clustering

SS can run with multiple front-end Web servers. For a critical instance, clustering offers a redundant system to limit potential down time from a single point of failure. Clustering also allows users to load balance for better performance. For instructions on enabling clustering in SS, see [Setting up Clustering](../../networking/secret-server-clustering/setting-up-clustering/index.md).
