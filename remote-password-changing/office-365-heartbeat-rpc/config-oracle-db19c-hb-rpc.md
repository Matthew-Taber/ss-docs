# Configuring Oracle DB 19c for Heartbeat and RPC

This document explains how to configure Oracle Database 19c for heartbeat and remote password changing (RPC) with Secret Server (SS). It consists of installing the Oracle Database Access Components (ODAC), configuring SS, and configuring one or more distributed engines.


> **Note**: This document is not updated with every releaseâ€”many releases do not affect the guide's contents and thus do not warrant a document update.

This Thycotic **technical configuration** knowledge base article is relevant to and has been tested on:

* Secret Server 10.7 on Windows Server 2016 Standard (64-bit)
* Distributed engine 10.7 on Windows Server 2016 Standard (64-bit)
* Oracle Database 19c on Windows Server 2019 Standard (64-bit)
 
## Introduction

This document explains how to configure Oracle Database 19c for heartbeat and remote password changing (RPC) with Secret Server (SS). The process consists of installing the Oracle Database Access Components (ODAC), configuring SS, and configuring one or more distributed engines.


## Procedure

### Task One: Installing the Oracle Database Access Components

1. Navigate to [ODAC Runtime Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/dotnet-odacdeploy-downloads.html) in your browser.

1. Download the latest version of the ODAC OUI file with the same major number as your database version.

You had me remove all of these yesterday.  As of October 22, 2019, the latest ODAC version is 19.3.

3. Unzip the file.

1. Right click and run setup.exe as a Windows administrator. The setup wizard appears.

1. Click to select **Use Windows Built-in Account**.

1. Click the **Next** button.

1. Type the desired installation path, such as `c:\oracle`.

1. Click the **Next** button.

1. Confirm the default product components are selected. If not, click to select **Reset Defaults**.

1. Click the **Next** button.

1. Leave the **DB Connection Configuration** fields as they are (empty).

1. Click the **Next** button. The setup runs some pre-installation configuration tests.

1. When the tests are completed, click the **Install** button.

1. Reboot your machine.

### Task Two: Configuring Secret Server

1. Navigate to the ODAC directory, such as c:\oracle.

1. Copy the `C:\oracle\product\19.x.x\client_1\odp.net\bin\4\Oracle.DataAccess.dll` file to the bin directory of your SS directory, for instance, `c:\inetpub\wwwroot\SecretServer\bin`.

1. Navigate to the `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config` directory.

1. Open the `machine.config` file.

1. Copy and paste the line below into the `DbProviderFactories` section:

`<add name="Oracle.DataAccess" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" description="Oracle Data Provider for .NET, Unmanaged Driver" type="Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.DataAccess, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342"/>`


The section should look like this:
```XML
<system.data>
	<DbProviderFactories>
      <add name="Oracle.DataAccess" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" description="Oracle Data Provider for .NET, Unmanaged Driver" type="Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.DataAccess, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342"/>
    </DbProviderFactories>
</system.data>
```

> **Note**: There may be additional `<Add>` sections, such as for Microsoft SQL Server. Leave them as is.

### Task Three: Configuring a Secret Server Distributed Engine

1. Navigate to the ODAC directory on the distributed engine machine, such as `c:\oracle`.

1. Copy the `C:\<ODAC_Directory>\odp.net\bin\4\Oracle.DataAccess.dll` file to the Distributed Engine directory, for instance, `C:\Program Files\Thycotic Software Ltd\Distributed Engine`.

1. Navigate to the `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config` directory.

1. Open the `machine.config` file.

1. If necessary, create a `<DbProviderFactories>` section within the <system.data> section.

1. Copy and paste the line below into the `<DbProviderFactories>` section:

`<add name="Oracle.DataAccess" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" description="Oracle Data Provider for .NET, Unmanaged Driver" type="Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.DataAccess, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342"/>`

The section should look like this:

```XML
<system.data>
	<DbProviderFactories>
      <add name="Oracle.DataAccess" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" description="Oracle Data Provider for .NET, Unmanaged Driver" type="Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.DataAccess, Version=4.122.19.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342"/>
    </DbProviderFactories>
</system.data>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Log Files

The errors below may appear in these files:

* `SS-BWSR.log` (SS)
* `SSDE.log` (distributed engine)

These files are located within the log subdirectory of the application's directory. Typically, these are:

* Secret Server: `c:\inetpub\wwwroot\secretserver\log\SS-BWSR.log`
* Distributed engines: `c:\program files\thycotic software ltd\distributed engine\log\SSDE.log`

### Errors

**Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleException: The provider is not compatible with the version of Oracle client**

This error occurs when the Oracle ODAC driver does not match the Oracle database version.

Uninstall the ODAC, and then re-install the correct version. You can uninstall ODAC using the universal installer that is included with the ODAC installation that resides in the ODAC directory.

**Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleException (0x80004005): ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor**

This error occurs when the secret's database field does not match the Oracle SERVICE_NAME database.

> **Note**: The default "Oracle Account" secret template's database field is looking for the Oracle SERVICE_NAME database. You can find that database's location by reading the tnsnames.ora configuration file on your Oracle database server.

**System.ArgumentException: Unable to find the requested .Net Framework Data Provider. It may not be installed.**

This error occurs when Oracle parameters are missing from the <dbProviderFactories> section in the machine.config file.

**System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException: Unrecognized element**

This error occurs when the <dbProviderFactories> section, located in the machine.config file, is not properly formatted.
