# Creating a Custom Password Changer

1. From the **Password Changers Configuration** page, click **New**.

1. Select a base password changer. We recommend you select the option that most closely matches the type of password changer you are creating, as this determines which customizable parameters and test actions are available to you.

1. On the next page, make any customizations you would like. To save a new command, click the **+** icon at the end of the row. The command can be edited once more by clicking the edit button, which is labeled with a small pencil icon at the end of the row.

1. To access the test actions for your new password changer, click **Back** to return to the overview screen.

1. To edit additional parameters (if applicable), click **Edit** from the password changer overview to change settings such as the name, line ending, and custom port.
