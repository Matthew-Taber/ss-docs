# Custom Password Changers

The Password Changers Configuration page can be accessed by navigating to **Admin > Remote Password Changing > Configure Password Changers**.

There are a few password changing types that allow the user to enter in specific commands that are sent to the computer where the password is changing. This enables the system to accommodate for differences in the standard password change procedure. For example: The Unix system that is being changed prompts for the current password twice instead of only once before asking for the new password.
