# Distributed Engines and RPC

Distributed Engines allow RPC, heartbeat and discovery to occur on networks that are not directly connected to the network that SS is installed on. See the linked KB and its associated white paper for details on configuration and functionality.

> **Note:** Distributed Engines were released in version 8.9.000000 and replaced remote agents.
