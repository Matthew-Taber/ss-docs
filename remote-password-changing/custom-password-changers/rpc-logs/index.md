# RPC Logs

The RPC logs for a specific secret can be accessed by clicking the **View Audit** button on Secret View page and ticking the check box at the bottom of the page for display password changing Log. The RPC logs for all secrets can be accessed by navigating to **Admin > Remote Password Changing**.

You can change the **Days to Keep Operational Logs** text box to set the period to keep RPC-related logs that might contain PII. SS automatically deletes logs older than that (in days).
