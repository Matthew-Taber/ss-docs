# Remote Password Changing

_Remote Password Changing_ (RPC) allows properly configured secrets to automatically update a corresponding remote account. Secrets can be set for automatic expiry so SS automatically generates a new strong password and change the remote password to keep all the account synchronized with SS.

If SS fails to change a remote password, an alert states there are secrets out of sync.
