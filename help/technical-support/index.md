## Getting Technical Support

> **Important:** Please see the **Support** link on the menu above for details about our support policies.

### Step One: Gather Information You May Need

Before you contact Support, gather the following information:

- Your Thycotic Support username and password
- The email account already associated with your account (if using email)
- Your company name
- The technical contact name
- The technical contact phone number
- The product name
- Issue symptoms and details
- Any other relevant details, such as hours the technical contact is present

### Step Two: Get a Mandatory Support PIN

#### Secret Server

The support PIN validates that your license includes support, and you must provide the PIN in your email or when you call. The PIN also makes it easier for Thycotic Support to locate your customer records and give you better support.

To get your PIN:

1. Get the log on the credentials you received when you became a Thycotic customer.

1. Log on the [Support Portal](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/login/) using your credentials.

1. On the main page, click the large blue **PIN** bar to get your PIN. The PIN appears on the button.

1. Record your PIN.

1. If you want to use our ticketing system for support, leave the browser tab open, and return for step four.

#### Secret Server Cloud

The support PIN validates that your license includes support, and you must provide the PIN in your email or when you call. The PIN also makes it easier for Thycotic Support to locate your customer records and give you better support. In addition, there is an additional "privileged PIN" for accessing your cloud instance.

To get your PIN:

1. Log on the Cloud Manager Dashboard at [https://portal.thycotic.com](https://portal.thycotic.com/).

1. Click the **Generate Tech Support** PIN button. A Tech Support PIN popup appears.

1. Record your PIN.

1. Click the Generate Privilege PIN button. Another Tech Support PIN popup appears.

1. Record your privileged PIN. Note that privileged PINs begin with "p"

   > **Important:** Providing us a privileged PIN gives Thycotic Technical Support write access to your cloud database for one day. Secrets and other sensitive data remain encrypted and unreadable.

### Step Three: Choose a Support Method

Thycotic customers have access to support by phone, email, and our support ticketing system (best for issue tracking). In all cases, **you must first obtain a support PIN**.

> **Important:** For Severity 1 issues you **must** use phone support. Otherwise, use the method you prefer.​ Severity 1 means a critical problem that has caused *complete loss of service* and work cannot reasonably continue at your worksite.​

### Step Four: Contact Support

Click the **Support** link on the menu above for Support email addresses and phone numbers.

Using one of the below methods, contact Thycotic Support.

#### Phone Support

Thycotic delivers support by phone worldwide. Select the applicable number from the list on the **Support** link in the menu above.

#### Email Support

Send your email to support@thycotic.com __with the PIN number as part of the subject line__ of your email. For example: PIN 345 Workflow Stopped Unexpectedly. Include all the information listed in step one.

> **Important:** You must send your email using an email address already noted in your account with Thycotic. Otherwise, it might delay our response.​
