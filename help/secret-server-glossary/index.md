| Term                          | Definition                                                   |

| 2FA                           | _Two-Factor Authentication_                                  |

| Administrator                 | Administrator (uppercase) is a default role that comes preconfigured with SS. Roles control access to features within SS. This role can be customized to have different permissions. In this guide, administrator (lowercase) is used when referring to users who manage the system and have control over global security and configuration settings. Note that administrators in SS do not automatically have access to all data stored in the system--access to data is still controlled by explicit permissions on that data. |

| Secret                        | A piece of information that is stored and managed within SS is referred to as a secret. Secrets are derived from Secret templates. Typical secrets include, but are not limited to, privileged passwords on routers, servers, applications, and devices. Files can also be stored in secrets, allowing for storage of private key files, SSL certificates, license keys, network documentation, Microsoft Word or Excel documents and more. |
| Secret Template               | Secret templates are used to create secrets and allow customization of the format and content of secrets to meet company needs and standards. Examples include: Local Administrator Account, SQL Server Account, Oracle Account, Credit Card and Web Password. Templates can contain passwords, usernames, notes, uploaded files, and drop-down list values. New Secret templates can be created, and all existing templates can be modified. |
