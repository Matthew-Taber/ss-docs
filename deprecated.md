# Deprecated or Missing Article or Topic

One of two things probably brought you here:

- The article that sent you here was marked as *deprecated*.

- A Secret Server page had a hyperlink to a nonexistent article, so you were either redirected or directed here.

This situation presents two possibilities:

- **The article or topic is updated and replicated here** in the [Thycotic Documentation Portal for Secret Server](./index.md). If a deprecated article sent you here, we suggest typing or pasting the title for the old article in the search box above and pressing \<Enter\>. The current equivalent should be at the top of the results. If a link in Secret Server or a legacy article sent you here, conduct a similar search for the title or subject of the referring Secret Server or legacy knowledgebase page.
- **The article or topic not been updated and is not available here**. If you searched to no avail and you still require the information, use the deprecated article or topic you came from (if that is how you arrived here). Alternatively, please contact  [Thycotic Technical Support](./support/index.md). They can make suggestions on how to proceed.

> **Note:** We chose to not simply link to the new version (when there is one) from the old because the TDP is constantly changing and improvingâ€”we do not want to waste already taxed resources maintaining hyperlinks on seldom seen, deprecated pages.
