# Password Loss and Assignment

Because users with access to a given doublelock each have their own separate password. Users that forget their doublelock password cannot simply ask another person using that doublelock for the password. Instead, one of the other users must reassign that forgetful user to the doublelock, and the user must choose a new password. This must occur for every doublelock the user was associated with. If no other doublelock users are available for the assignment to a given secret (there is only one associated doublelock password), the forgetful user is out of luck, and the secret will be destroyed when the user receives a new doublelock password.
