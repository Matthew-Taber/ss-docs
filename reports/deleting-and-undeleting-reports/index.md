# Deleting or Undeleting Reports

To delete or undelete a report.

- **Delete:** To delete a report, click the **Delete** button.

- **Undelete:** To undelete a report, you must navigate to the Reports Edit page as deleted reports are not visible on the Reports View page. On the Reports Edit page, click the **Show Deleted** button. This displays a Deleted Report category, which contains all the deleted reports. Either drag the report to a report category that is not deleted or click the report name to go into its Report View page. In there, click the **Undelete** button.
