# Reporting and Dual Controls

If there are requirements around protecting potentially personally identifying information when running reports or viewing recorded sessions, you can enforce that another user has authorized you by enabling dual control for a secret or Report. You can configure Dual Controls by clicking **Admin** and then **Dual Controls**.

> **Note:** Dual Controls is not in the **Admin** dropdown and must be accessed from the full administration menu.

When enabled a user in the approver group must enter in their credentials before a report or session can be viewed:

Once the approver has entered their credentials, the resource can be accessed. The following resources can have dual control applied.

- **Access Report:** Protects any report from the General tab of the Reports view.

- **Access User Audit Report:** Protects the user audit report for any user.

- **Create Report**: Requires dual control for anytime a user creates a custom report.

- **Secret Session Access:** Requires dual control for any recorded or live sessions for a secret
