# Reports

The reporting interface comes with a set of standard reports. These reports include a variety of 2D and 3D charting and graphing components and a full grid of data. Some of the reports are purely data detailed and have no charts. You can also create your own reports based on any SS data, such as user, audit, permissions, and folders. You can create report categories to aid in the organization of your reports. Reports can be arranged to provide access to auditors and meet compliance requirements. These reports can be accessed in the **General** tab on the **Reports** page.

The _Security Hardening Report_ checks aspects of SS to ensure security best practices are being implemented. While SS runs with all the items failing, administrators should be aware of possible security issues within an installation. For details on this, see [Reports Security Hardening Tab](#Reports-Security-Hardening-Tab).

The User Audit Report shows all secrets accessed by a user during a specified period. For a detailed explanation of this, see [User Audit Report](#User-Audit-Report).
