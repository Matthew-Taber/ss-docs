# Viewing Reports

On this page you see the graph, chart, grid, etc. for the report. To see a grid representation of the report, click the **Show Data** link to expand that area. If there is no data, then no graph is visible and the text "There are no items" displays in the Show Data section.

Some reports use dynamic values like user, start date, and end date. Adjust these values to generate the report you need. Click the **Update Report** button to generate the new report.

The **Edit** button allows you to alter the report to fit your requirements. See the Creating and Editing a Report section below for details.
