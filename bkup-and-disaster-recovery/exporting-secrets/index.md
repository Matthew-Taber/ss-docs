# Exporting Secrets

From within the **Administration > Export** page, select the folder that needs to be exported. By default, all secrets are exported if a folder is not selected. If no folder is selected, all secrets are exported by default. The administrative password must be entered, as it is a security measure to verify the permission of the user performing the export.

> **Note:** Only the secrets the user has view access to are exported.

Exports can be configured further with options to "Export with Folder Path" and "Export Child Folders." Export with Folder Path adds the full folder path to the export. Folder paths in the export file provide organizational structure if secrets need to be imported later.

By default, the option to "Export Child Folders" is active. While this option is enabled, any export of a specified folder also exports content located in folders beneath the initial selection.
