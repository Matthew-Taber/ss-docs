# Unlimited Administration Mode

_Unlimited administration mode_ is a feature designed to allow an administrator access to all secrets and folders in their SS instance without explicit permission. This can be used in the instance a company has an emergency where access to a secret is needed when no users who have permission are available. Alternately, it can be used when company policies require administrators to have access to all information in the system.

> **Note:** An alert visible to all users displays at the top of the Secret View page when unlimited administration mode is enabled.

For a user to be an unlimited administrator they must be assigned a role with the Unlimited Administrator permission and Unlimited Administration Mode must be enabled in Configuration settings.

To navigate to the **Unlimited Administration** section, select **Configuration** from the **Administration** menu, and then click **Change Administration Mode**. We recommend administrators have specific permissions to folders and secrets and this mode is only used temporarily to assign the correct permissions.

> **Note:** Changes to the administration mode are logged in an audit grid. The grid shows the user, time of the change, and any notes made by the user.
