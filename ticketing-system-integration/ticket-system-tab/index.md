# Ticket System Tab

SS can allow users to enter a ticket number when viewing a secret. This number can be validated through a regular expression, and can also be marked as required, if needed. SS can integrate with third party ticket systems. For more information on the ticket system integration, see Ticket System Integration with SS (KB).

You can add multiple ticket systems from the **Ticket System** tab. To add a new system, click **New Ticket System**.

You can make a select ticket system be SS's default ticketing system by clicking on the link of the desired system, then clicking **Set as Default**.
