SS can allow users to enter a ticket number when viewing a secret. This number can be validated through a regular expression, and can also be marked as required, if needed. SS can integrate with third party ticket systems. For more information on the ticket system integration, see [Ticket System Integration with SS](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/Ticket-System-Integration-With-Secret-Server) (KBA).
