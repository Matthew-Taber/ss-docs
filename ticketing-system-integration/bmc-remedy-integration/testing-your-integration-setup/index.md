# Testing Your Integration Setup

After configuring the ticket system (see configurable settings below), use the **Test Validation** button to verify that SS can successfully access BMC Remedy. This button opens a dialog in which you can enter a ticket number from BMC Remedy. This validation process returns success or an error code. BMC Remedy may not return much detail in the error message so you need to look at the BMC Remedy API log to see a detailed error message, see [BMC Remedy Error Messages](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?TicketingSystemBmcRemedyErrors) (KBA).
