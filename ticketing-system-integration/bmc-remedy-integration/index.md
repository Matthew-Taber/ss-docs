SS can integrate with BMC Remedy's Incident and Change Management. This integration includes validating ticket numbers, their status, and adding work detail items to the request.

The integration with BMC Remedy leverages the out-of-the-box,  SOAP-based Web services that are installed with the ITSM product installation. These services must be installed on your mid-tier BMC Remedy server to allow for this integration if they are not already installed and configured.
