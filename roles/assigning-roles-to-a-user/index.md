# Assigning Roles to a User

To assign roles to a user, click the **Assign Roles** button on the main **Roles** page. Depending on which tab is selected, this page allows you either view the roles that are assigned to users or view the users that are assigned to roles. To change these settings, click the **Edit** button. Now select a role from the list and assign or unassign users to the role. In the **By User or Group** tab, you can select a user or group from the list and assign or unassign roles to them in the selectable list boxes.
