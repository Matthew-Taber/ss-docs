# Setting Up Synchronization Groups

Once a domain has been added, the **Synchronization Groups** needs to be set by clicking the **Edit Synchronization** button on the **Active Directory Configuration** page. The Available groups represent all accessible groups on the specified Active Directory domain. The user membership can be previewed with the **Group Preview** control. Select the desired group from the available groups that contains the Active Directory accounts for users you would like to create in SS. If the specific group does not exist, one can be created by your Active Directory administrator. If you create domain users manually or converting local users to domain users, then see the corresponding sections below before setting the synchronization group.
