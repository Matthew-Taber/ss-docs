# Webservices

SS provides a suite of webservices which can be used to retrieve and update secrets, and folders. The webservices allow SS to be accessed using the mobile apps as well as custom built integrations. The webservices are secure and require authentication in the same manner as regular access to SS. All actions that involve data are also logged, such as secret views, updates, and adds.
