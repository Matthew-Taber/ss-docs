# Windows Integrated Authentication Webservice

SS also provides a webservice that uses integrated Windows authentication instead of a username and password. This webservice can be used in an application or script to access SS and retrieve secrets with storing the login credentials in the application or configuration file.

> **Note:** See the [Windows Integrated Authentication Webservice](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?SSUserGuide_WindowsIntegratedAuthenticationWebservice) KB article for more advanced technical information on using this webservice.
