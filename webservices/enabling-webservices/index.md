# Enabling Webservices

Webservices can be enabled at the **Administration > Configuration** general tab. Enabling webservices simply makes the ASP.NET webservices built into SS available. They are found under `/webservices/sswebservice.asm` in your SS directory. They run on the same port as the Web application. You can view them with a browser to see the functionality that is offered. Specific webservice functionality is documented in the SS Webservice API guide.
