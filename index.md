Thycotic Secret Server (SS) is an enterprise-grade, privileged access management solution that is quickly deployable and easily managed. With SS, you can automatically discover and manage your privileged accounts through an intuitive interface, protecting against malicious activity, enterprise-wide.

>**Important:** The online SS documentation (Homer) is in a transitional phase and does not yet contain all SS documentation. For now, there are many locations here where this online documentation links to legacy documentation which you can find here: [Secret Server Legacy Documentation](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/secretserver).
