# Secret Server Clustering

SS can run with multiple front-end Web servers. For a critical instance, clustering offers a redundant system to limit potential down time from a single point of failure. Clustering also allows users to load balance for better performance. For instructions on enabling clustering in SS, see [Setting up Clustering](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?ClusteringSetup) (KB).
