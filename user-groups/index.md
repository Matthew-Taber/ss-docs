# User Groups

SS allows administrators to manage users through *user groups*. Users can belong to different groups and receive the sharing permissions, as well as roles, attributed to those groups. This setup simplifies the management of the permissions and roles that can be assigned to a user. Additionally, groups can be synchronized with Active Directory to further simplify management.
