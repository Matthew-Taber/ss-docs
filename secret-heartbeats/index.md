SS's _heartbeat_ feature allows secrets to have their entered credentials automatically tested for accuracy at a given interval. Using heartbeat on secrets ensures those credentials are up-to-date and can alert administrators if the credentials are changed outside of SS. Heartbeat helps manage secrets and prevent them from being out of sync.
