Secret server has several out-of-the-box integrations that do not require extensive third-party support or documentation. This section discusses those integrations.

> **Note:** This section does not address RPC or heartbeat "integrations," which are covered elsewhere in the Thycotic Documentation Portal. For typical third-party integrations, such as Splunk or ConnectWise, see the [Integration Guides](https://docs.thycotic.com/ssi).
