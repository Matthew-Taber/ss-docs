# RDP Proxy Configuration

## Overview

The RDP Proxying feature allows RDP connections, established using a launcher, to be routed through SS. You can set it up one of two ways:

- Recommended method: The launcher connects to the newer RDP proxy with temporary credentials, and the RDP proxy connects to the remote server using the protected credentials from the secret. This method is preferred because it prevents the secret credentials from reaching the client machine. For this method, you simply configure the RDP proxy.

- Alternative method: The launcher uses an SSH proxy to tunnel a local RDP connection to a remote server. This method does not protect the credential from reaching the client machine. For this method you configure the SSH proxy and enable SSH tunneling. 

>**Note:** We provide the alternate method to support legacy installations and troubleshooting (it can potentially be more stable when the RDP proxy does not work).

These two approaches to RDP proxying are not compatibleâ€”you may use one or the other but not both. We performance tested both methods. Either can support 100 concurrent connections.

   > **Note:** The secret credentials *do not* get served to the client machine in this flow, which improves credential security.

### Configuration

### Configuration Settings 

The RDP proxy configuration settings for the recommended method:

- **Enable RDP Proxy:** This setting determines whether or not the RDP proxy is enabled

- **RDP Proxy Port:** This setting is the port that the RDP proxy runs on (defaulting to 3390). You usually cannot set this to 3389 as that port is already occupied by default by the Windows operating system.

- **Enable RDP Proxy:** This setting determines whether or not the RDP proxy is enabled

- **Allow AD site selection:** This setting allows you to select any configured sites when using the RDP launcher on an Active Directory secret. This allows a secret credential to access machines that may exist in different network boundaries.

- **Enable RDP Proxy:** This setting determines whether or not the RDP proxy is enabled

- **Days To Keep Operational Logs:** This setting determines how long, in days, the operational logs for the RDP proxy are kept.

- **RDP Server Certificate:** This setting is the certificate that is served to the clients who connect to the RDP proxy. You can generate a certificate for a given DNS name, or you can upload your own.

## Alternative Method

> **Note:** This approach is not recommended as it exposes the secret credentials to the client machine.

## Known Issues

### "Could not load file or assembly..." Error

Error appears in SS.log or DE.log. Install the most recent version of the .NET Framework to correct it.

### RDP Proxy Does Not Work with FIPS Validation

RDP proxy does not work on machines the have the FIPS validation security policy active. No fix is currently available.
