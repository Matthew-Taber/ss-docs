# Report Auditing

In addition to the user audit and individual secret audit, the reporting feature provides a series of activity, user, and secret reports. See [Built-In Reports](https://updates.thycotic.net/links.ashx?BuiltInReports) (KB) for the most up-to-date list of reports included.

> **Note:** Users can also create their own, custom reports. See [Creating and Editing Reports](#Creating-and-Editing-Reports).
