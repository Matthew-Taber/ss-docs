# Report Auditing

In addition to the user audit and individual secret audit, the reporting feature provides a series of activity, user, and secret reports. See [Built-in Reports](../../../reports/built-in-reports/index.md) for the most up-to-date list of reports included.

> **Note:** Users can also create their own, custom reports. See [Creating and Editing Reports](../../../reports/creating-and-editing-reports/index.md).
