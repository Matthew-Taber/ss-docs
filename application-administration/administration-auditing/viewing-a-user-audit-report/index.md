# Viewing a User Audit Report

1. From the **Reports** page, click the **User Audit** tab. 
2. From the dialog on the tab, select a user and a date range to view.
3. Click **Search History** to view the user's audit trail.

The audit search displays results for all the secrets the selected user has viewed or edited during the selected time period. The administrator has the option of expiring all the viewed secrets, to notify users to change sensitive information, or to force password changing (if the RPC is configured).

To get a full view of the actions taken on a secret, select that secret from the results list. The secret audit displays the specific user actions for a secret.
