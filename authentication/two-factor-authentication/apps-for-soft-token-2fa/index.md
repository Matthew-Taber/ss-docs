# Applications for Soft Token Two-Factor Authentication

“TOTP Authenticator” is the name of the Secret Server soft token two-factor setting. Any TOTP application that uses the TOTP RFC6238 algorithm, such as such as Microsoft [Authenticator](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b), will work with the Secret Server TOTP Authenticator. Details on the TOTP RFC6238 standard can be found at [TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238).

Note: Google Authenticator support started in Secret Server version 8.6.
