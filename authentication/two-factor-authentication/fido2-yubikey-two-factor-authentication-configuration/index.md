# FIDO2 (YubiKey) Two-Factor Authentication Configuration

## FIDO2

FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online, second edition) is an open authentication standard that uses physical devices for authentication. Thycotic uses it for two factor authentication (2FA) with FIDO2 providing the second authentication after a normal password entryâ€”any FIDO2-enabled user attempting access to a SS account **must** have a FIDO2 device in hand. The device eliminates many password-related issues, such as phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. It also speeds up the long on process over callback or texting 2FA.

## YubiKey

YubiKey is a FIDO2-compliant product series from Yubico, a commercial company. We recommend two of their devices--YubiKey 5 Series and Security Key by Yubico.
