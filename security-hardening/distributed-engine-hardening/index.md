# Distributed Engine Hardening

## Introduction

This topic discusses best practices for hardening Secret Server distributed engine servers.

If attackers compromise one of the DE servers, they would have access to all critical DBs, applications, and network devices at the network level. DEs do not store any passwords, PII, or user data in any configuration files.

> **Note:** Due to their intrinsic nature, some PowerShell script run by DEs may expose API usernames or passwords in the PowerShell log.

## General Hardening Steps

### Restrict RDP Connections

- Limit RDP connections to all PAM Server,  except for PAM admins and some users from the hosting team.
- If there is no firewall segmentation in LAN network, you can accomplish this with the Windows OS firewall.

### Restrict Incoming Port Access to All DE Servers

- Allow only RDP port access from some internal IPs.
- Allow a SSH proxy port coming from the user's LAN.
- Block all other incoming ports.

### Remove Unnecessary User Groups

For administrator and Remote Desktop user groups:

- Remove default domain admins, administrator and some common groups.
-  Create one group that is going to have access these servers.
- Disable the built-in local administrator user.

### Rename Default Accounts

- Change the names of both the administrator and guest accounts to names that do not indicate their permissions.
- Create a new locked and unprivileged "administrator" user name as bait.

### Disable Services

Disable these services:

- Routing and remote access
- Smart card
- Smart card removal policy
- SNMP trap
- Special administration console helper
- Windows error reporting service
- WinHTTP Web proxy auto-discovery service

### Restrict Network Protocols

Keep these:

- Client for Microsoft network
- File and printer sharing for Microsoft network
- Internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4)

Remove these:

- QoS packet scheduler
- Link-layer topology discovery mapper IO driver
- Link-layer topology discovery responder

### Validate Server Roles

Ensure only the minimum roles and features that are required are defined on the DE Servers. Remove all unnecessary roles and features

#### Roles

##### Application Server

- TCP port sharing
- Windows process activation service support
- Named pipe activation
- TCP activation

##### Remote Access

- Direct access and VPN (RAS)
- Routing
- Web application proxy (with dependent features)

##### Web Server (IIS)

- Web server
- Health and diagnostic
- Logging tools
- Tracing

##### Security

- Centralized SSL certificate support
- Client certificate mapping authentication
- Digest authentication
- IIS client certificate mapping authentication
- IP and domain restrictions
- URL authentication

##### Application Development

- Server side includes
- Web socket protocols
- Windows deployment services (with dependent features), including all child roles

#### Features

- Group policy management
- IIS hostable Web core
- Ink and handwriting services
- Media foundation
- RAS connection manager administration kit (CMAK)
- Remote server administration tools, including all child features.
- Windows internal database
- SMB 1.0/CIFS file sharing support

## SSL/TLS Settings

Keep your server SSL/TLS settings up to date. Among other settings, the different protocols and cipher suites can be vulnerable to different attacks on SSL/TLS.

- Disable SSL 2.0
- Disable SSL 3.0
- Disable TLS 1.0
- Disable TLS 1.1
- Enable TLS 1.2

## GPO Hardening

The following are recommended settings for Microsoft Group Policy Objects (GPO).

The user could then take ownership of any file,  grant themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that  most removable storage devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical  button diminishes the advantage of this policy setting.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Devices: Prevent  users from installing printer drivers      | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  A malicious user  could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage  the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that  masquerades as a printer driver.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Domain member:  Disable machine account password changes     | Disabled                                                     | Vulnerability:  Computers that  cannot automatically change their account password are at risk from an  attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Domain member:  Maximum machine account password age         | 30 days                                                      | Vulnerability:  Setting this  parameter to 0 will allow an attacker to execute Brute Force attacks to find  the computer account password.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Domain member:  Require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  Session keys that  are used to establish secure channel communications between domain  controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they  were in previous Windows operating systems.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Interactive logon:  Do not display last user name            | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  An attacker with  access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone  who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services, also  known as Terminal Services) could view the name of the last user who logged  on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a  dictionary, or use a brute force attack to try to log on.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Interactive logon:  Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL              | Disabled                                                     | Vulnerability:  If users are not  required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt  to intercept their passwords, If this setting is enabled, an attacker could  install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard logon dialog box  in the Windows operating system, and capture the user's password.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Interactive logon:  Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not  available). | 0                                                            | Vulnerability:  Users who access the  server console will have their logon credentials cached on that server. An  attacker who is able to access the file system of the server could locate  this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine  user passwords.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational  aspects: The local  Administrator password should be known in case of DC unavailability. |
| Interactive logon:  Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  By default, the  computer caches in memory the credentials of any users who are authenticated  locally. The computer uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone  who attempts to unlock the console. When cached credentials are used, any  changes that have recently been made to the accountâ€”such as user rights  assignments, account lockout, or the account being disabledâ€”are not considered  or applied after the account is authenticated. User privileges are not  updated, and (more important) disabled accounts are still able to unlock the  console of the computer.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  The local  Administrator password should be known in case of DC unavailability |
| Microsoft network  client: Send unencrypted password to third-party SMB servers. | Disabled                                                     | Vulnerability:  The server can transmit  passwords in plaintext across the network to other computers that offer SMB  services. These other computers might not use any of the SMB security  mechanisms that are included with Windows Server 2003 and above.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Microsoft network  server: Amount of idle time required before suspending session | 15 minutes                                                   | Vulnerability:  Each SMB session  consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow the server or  possibly cause it to fail. An attacker could repeatedly establish SMB  sessions until the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Microsoft network  server: Attempt S4U2Self to obtain claim information | Disabled                                                     | Vulnerability:  Enabling this policy  setting allows you take advantage of features in Windows Server 2012 and  Windows 8 for specific scenarios to use claims-enabled tokens to access files  or folders that have claim-based access control policy applied on Windows  operating systems prior to Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Microsoft network  server: Server SPN target name validation level | Off                                                          | Vulnerability:  This policy setting  controls the level of validation that a server with shared folders or  printers performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by the  client computer when the client computer establishes a session by using the  SMB protocol. The level of validation can help prevent a class of attacks  against SMB servers (referred to as SMB relay attacks). This setting will  affect both SMB1 and SMB2.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access: Do  not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  An unauthorized user  could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use the  information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering  attacks.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access: Do  not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  An unauthorized user  could anonymously list account names and shared resources and use the  information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social-engineering  attacks.  Severity of the damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access: Do  not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication. | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  Passwords that are  cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the computer. Although  this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user  unknowingly runs malicious software that reads the passwords and forwards  them to another, unauthorized user.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  This parameter could  affect windows schedule task services |
| Network access: Let  Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users | Disabled                                                     | Vulnerability:  The system will  allow all users, including users who have not identified themselves in the  Domain, perform operations of reading information related to user accounts  and the names of the shares.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously | List has been  deleted                                       | Vulnerability:  Ability to remotely  access data on the system by an unauthorized user.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Remotely accessible registry paths          | List has been  deleted                                       | Vulnerability:  An attacker could  use information in the registry to facilitate unauthorized activities. To  reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned throughout the  registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Remotely accessible registry paths and subpaths | List has been deleted                                        | Vulnerability:  An attacker could  use information in the registry to facilitate unauthorized activities. To  reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are assigned throughout the  registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares. | Enabled                                                      | Vulnerability:  Null sessions are a  weakness that can be exploited through shared folders on computers  environment.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Shares that can be accessed anonymously     | List has been  deleted                                       | Vulnerability:  Any shared folders  that are listed can be accessed by any network user, which could lead to the  exposure or corruption of sensitive data.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Network access:  Sharing and security model for local accounts | Classic - Local  users authenticate as themselves            | Vulnerability:  With the Guest only  model, any user who can authenticate to the server over the network does so  with guest privileges, which means that they will not have write access to  shared resources on that server. Although this restriction does increase  security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared  resources on the server because ACLs on those resources must include access  control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local  accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled,  anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system resources.

| Lock pages in memory                                         | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  Users with the Lock  pages in memory user right could assign physical memory to several processes,  which could leave little or no RAM for other processes and result in a DoS  condition.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Manage auditing and  security log                            | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  Anyone with the  Manage auditing and security log user right can clear the Security log to  erase important evidence of unauthorized activity.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Modify an object  label                                      |                                                              | Vulnerability:  Anyone with the  Modify an object label user right can change the integrity level of a file or  process so that it becomes elevated or decreased to a point where it can be  deleted by lower-level processes. Either of these states effectively  circumvents the protection offered by Windows Integrity Controls and makes  your system vulnerable to attacks by malicious software.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Modify firmware  environment values                          | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  Anyone who is  assigned the Modify firmware environment values user right could configure  the settings of a hardware component to cause it to fail, which could lead to  data corruption or a DoS condition.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Perform volume  maintenance tasks                            | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  A user who is assigned  the Perform volume maintenance tasks user right could delete a volume, which  could result in the loss of data or a DoS condition. Also, disk maintenance  tasks can be used to modify data on the disk such as user rights assignments  that might lead to escalation of privileges.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Profile single  process                                      | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  The Profile single  process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with this  user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical  processes that they might want to attack directly. Attackers may be able to  determine what processes run on the computer so that they could identify  countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as antivirus software or an  intrusion-detection system. They could also identify other users who are  logged on to a computer.  Severity of the damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Restore files and  directories                               | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  An attacker with the  Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a  computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of  important data, data corruption, or a denial-of-service condition. Attackers  could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators  or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant  themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install programs that  provide continued access to the computer.  Severity of the  damage:  Medium  Operational aspects:  None |
| Shut down the system                                         | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  The ability to shut  down the server should be limited to a very small number of trusted  administrators.  Severity of the  damage:  Low  Operational aspects:  None |
| Take ownership of  files or other objects                    | BUILTIN\Administrators                                       | Vulnerability:  Any users with the  Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take control of any  object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any  changes that they want to make that object. Such changes could result in  exposure of data, corruption of data, or a DoS condition.  Severity of the  damage:  High  Operational aspects:  None |
