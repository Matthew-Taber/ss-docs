> **Note:** The discovery account must be part of the local admin's group to be able to pull back any local accounts.

## Windows Services, Scheduled Tasks, App Pools, and COM+ Applications

> **Note:** There are special considerations for discovering service accounts running COM+ Applications, please see the following for instructions: [COM+ Dependency Scanner](https://thycotic.force.com/support/s/article/ka037000000HtkmAAC/COMPlus-Depenency-Scanner) (KBA).

To scan for service accounts, the account entered must be a domain account that is in the Administrators group on the target machines. Follow the instructions below in either case to ensure your account has the appropriate privileges to run a successful scan:

1. Open the group policy editor for your domain policy.

1. Go to **Computer** **Configuration** \> **Preferences** \> **Control Panel Settings**.

1. Right-click **Local Users and groups** and select **New** > **Local Group.**

1. Leave the **Action** dropdown list set to **Update**.

1. Click to select **Administrators (Built-in)** in the **Group Members** dropdown list.

1. Click the **Addâ€¦** button.

1. Search for the account you will use for discovery scanning.

1. Click the **OK** button to save your changes. The next time the group policy updates across your environment, the discovery account will be part of the local administrators group.

1. For strong security, configure the group policy to limit the logon privileges of that account:

   1. Open the group policy editor

   1. For your domain policy, go to **Computer Configuration** \> **Policies** \> **Windows Settings** \> **Security Settings** \> **Local Policies** \> **User Rights Assignment**.

   1. Add your discovery account to the **Deny log on locally** policy.

   1. Add your discover account to the **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** policy.

   1. (Optional) Ensure the account is not part of the remote desktop users group.
