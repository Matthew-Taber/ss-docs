# Discovery on Non-Domain Joined or Unix Targets

## Overview

When running discovery on non-domain joined targets or Unix targets, there are two methods of finding local administrator credentials to authenticate to the target, and the methods can be used together.

* Specify a secret with an expected default password, recommended for performing an initial scan if you have a known password or key for a privileged account.
* Specify a secret search filter, recommended when you cannot use a default password because each machineâ€™s account password is unique. A Secret Search Filter dynamically searches for a secret with a name or folder location that corresponds to the target scanned. If a matching secret is found, Secret Server will authenticate to the target using the administrator credentials in the secret.

>**Note**: To use a secret search filter, the administrator account names must exist as secrets in Secret Server and they must follow a regular naming pattern.

>**Note**: The discovery secret search filter is available in Secret Server 10.0.000006 and newer.

## Setting Credentials on a Discovery Scanner

1. In a discovery source, click the Edit icon on a scanner.

1. In the Settings window, under **Secret Credentials**, choose among the following options:

   * Click **Add Secret** to specify a default credential.
   * Click **Add Secret Search Filter** to specify an existing secret search filter.
   * Click **Create Secret Search Filter** to create a new secret search filter.

Secret Server will try the secrets and secret search filters in sequence until it finds a match.

## Creating a Secret Search Filter

1. In the **Secret Credentials** section, click **Create Secret Search Filter**.

1. In the New Secret Search Filter window, specify a secret name pattern and settings as described below:

   * **Secret Name Pattern**: Specifies the pattern that Secret Server will search for. The search is dynamic based on the target. In the example depicted in the screen shot, if scanning a machine named `appserver01`, Secret Server will also search for a secret named `appserver01\system`.
   * **Secret Template**: Specifies the template that returned secrets should be based on. In the example depicted in the screen shot, only secrets based on the Oracle Account template will be returned.
   * **Folder**: Specifies the folder to search within.
   * **Include Subfolders**: Specifies that the search should include not only the specified folder, but the subfolders as well.
   * **Allow Partial Match**: Specifies that secret names will be returned if they partially match the pattern. By default the secret name must be an exact match to the secret name pattern.
   * **Expect Single**: Specifies that only one result should be returned. If more than one is returned, Secret Server will log an error to the discovery log.

1. Click **OK** and go back to your discovery source.
1. Click **Add Secret Search Filter** and select the filter you just created.

Now, when scanning a machine, Secret Server will try a default credential, and then it will try the secret returned by the search filter.
