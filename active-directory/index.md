# Active Directory

Secret Server can integrate with Active Directory by allowing users to use  their Active Directory credentials to log on Secret Server.

> **Note:** Before synchronizing or creating users, you need to create a secret to be used as the "sync secret." This secret should contain Domain Admin credentials (or an account with appropriate permissions to search and view the attributes to all your organization's users and groups).
