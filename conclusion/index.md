# Conclusion

There is no one way for building your structure. You will need to use a mixed approach, relying on automated sorting in some areas while forcing the order of your contents in others.

We are using index.md as kind of a landing page/intro page into each folder/contents section. If you don't pay attention to other file names in the same folder, you might end up with your intro in the middle of that section's TOC. You just need to pay attention that your intro into each main subject area does not accidentally end up on the bottom of your outline or that you explain decommissioning a system before telling a customer how to ever stand-up a system.

Index.md is not automatically placed first in a section outline, if you have file names starting with anything falling before "index" alphabetically, the index file moves down in the published TOC when priority tags aren't specified accordingly.
